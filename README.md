# Assignment_1

Started with #include <iostream> so that the input and output could be produced

Used int main to store the code.

Used "using std" on cout, cin, and endl so I don't have to write it every time.

Used cout on all my sentences so that they are read as an output.

Ended all my lines with endl.

Used return 0 to see if coded worked.
